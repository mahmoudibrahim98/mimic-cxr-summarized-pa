 Emphysema and scarring are so severe that it is difficult to say whether

 Spontaneous pneumothorax even in patients with severe emphysema is relatively
 rare and raises concern for predisposing conditions such as a subpleural

 Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left, both
 minimally larger than on ___.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size normal. 
 Irregular aeration of the right lower lung could be atelectasis secondary to
 the effusion.
 
 Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes.  Transvenous right atrial and
 ventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses.  Patient has had median
 sternotomy and mitral valve replacement.","Small-moderate bilateral pleural effusions (R>L), slightly increased; no PTX; normal heart size. RLL irregular aeration likely atelectasis from effusion. Pacer leads in place. Sternotomy/MVR."

 of a pre-existing right pleural effusion. The areas of atelectasis on the
 right are also increasing. On the left, and new perihilar parenchymal opacity
 has occurred that could represent pneumonia or aspiration. Normal size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged left pectoral pacemaker and right Port-A-Cath.",Vs prior: slight increase R pleural effusion and R atelectasis. New L perihilar opacity ?pneumonia/aspiration. Cardiac size normal. Left pacemaker and right Port-A-Cath unchanged.
s52750463,19997367,"Status post exchange of a right pectoral Port-A-Cath. The new device is in
 correct position, the tip of the intravascular part projects over the right
 atrium.  No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Unchanged mild
 overinflation, unchanged right pleural effusion that, on today's in image,
 extends into the minor fissure.  Normal size of the heart, normal position of
 the left pectoral pacemaker.","Right chest port exchanged; tip at right atrium. No complications or pneumothorax. Mild hyperinflation stable. Right pleural effusion into minor fissure, stable. Heart size and left pacer normal."

 recently ___:
 
 ___ x 22 mm elliptical opacity projecting over the cardiac apex on the frontal
 view could be the lung nodule referenced.  I cannot identify it on the
 lateral.  Loss of volume in the right lung is attributable to right upper
 lobectomy and obscuration of the right heart border and anterior aspect of the
 right hemidiaphragm could be due to anatomic rearrangement stemming from
 surgery.  Upper lungs are clear.  The heart is normal size.  Thoracic aorta is
 mildly dilated and very tortuous.  There is no pleural effusion.  I see no
 explanation for decreased breath sounds in the left lower chest, except the
 patient has moderately extensive emphysema generally.
 
 There is suggestion of additional small lung nodules in the left lower lobe,
 projecting over the descending thoracic aorta, and perhaps in one of the upper
 lobes retrosternally on the lateral view projecting just superior to the
 ascending thoracic aorta.  The reference chest CT scans should be reviewed
 with that in mind.","CXR: ~22 mm opacity over cardiac apex (possible nodule), not seen on lateral. Post-RUL lobectomy. Dilated/tortuous aorta. Moderate emphysema. Possible nodules LLL and retrosternal UL; CT correlation."
